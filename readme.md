# Welcome to Valet labs

These Valet labs let you test drive Valet by bootstrapping the environment of your choosing. To get started:

1. Get access to Valet and create your own GitHub repository. See the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) below.
2. Bootstrap your environment. The default page of the lab of your choosing will detail how to configure and run the action to bootstrap the environment. Currently these labs support [Azure DevOps](azure_devops).
3. Run Valet via Codespaces. The codespace has docker running and will update to the latest Valet environment.
4. Proceed with running the labs!

# Prerequisites

1. Valet is currently private and customers must be onboarded prior to using it. Please reach out to [GitHub Sales](https://github.com/enterprise/contact) to inquire about being granted access.
2. Create your own GitHub repository in your own GitHub organization or under your user with Codespaces enabled using this repository as a template. To do so:
   - Navigate to the top of this repository and click `Use this template`.
   - Select the owner of the new repository. It could be your personal username or an organization you belong to.
   - Name the repository.
   - Click `Create repository from template`.
   - Proceed to the labs inside your new repository.
