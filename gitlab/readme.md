# Valet labs for GitLab

This lab bootstraps a Valet environment using GitHub Codespaces and enables you to run the Valet CI/CD migration tool against an isolated GitLab instance running in Docker. 

- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
- [Setup Codespace for Labs](#setup-codespace-for-labs)
- [Labs for GitLab](#labs-for-gitlab)


## Prerequisites
1. [Valet Labs](https://github.com/valet-customers/labs) template has been used to generate this repository.

## Setup Codespace for Labs

1. Start the codespace
    - Click the `Code` button down arrow above the repository on the repository's landing page.
    - Click the `Codespaces` tab.
    - Click `Create codespaces on main` to create the codespace. If you are in another branch then the `main` branch, the codespace button will have the current branch specified.
    - Wait a couple minutes, then verify that the codespace starts up. Once it is fully booted up, the terminal should be present.
2. Verify Valet CLI is installed and working. More information on the [GitHub Valet CLI extension](https://github.com/github/gh-valet)
    -  Run `gh valet version` in the codespace terminal and verify it returns results like below, actual versions will vary.
    ```
        gh version 2.14.3 (2022-07-26)
        gh valet        github/gh-valet v0.1.12
        valet-cli       v0.1.0.13392
    ```
    if results do not match try manually installing the valet extension, using the [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section.
    
3. Run the GitLab setup script.  This script will set up GitLab and ensure it is ready to use.  In general, this script should be run first if you are starting a new codespace or restarting an existing one.  
   -  from the codespace terminal run `source gitlab/bootstrap/setup.sh`.

4. Verify you can login to the GitLab Server.
   - Click the `PORTS` tab in the codespace terminal window.
   - In the row that starts with `80` mouse over the address under the column heading `Local Address`, and click the globe icon.
   - Verify a new browser tab opened to the GitLab login screen.
   - Login with the username: `root` and password: `valet-labs!`.
   - Verify that you can see the auto populated projects in GitLab, under the `valet` namespace by clicking the `Menu` icon in GitLab, then `Your projects`.

## Labs for GitLab
Perform the following labs to test-drive Valet
- TBD

## Troubleshooting
-  **GitHub CLI Valet extension is not installed**. More information on the [GitHub Valet CLI extension](https://github.com/github/gh-valet)
   -  Verify you are in the codespace terminal
   -  Run `gh extension install github/gh-valet`
   -  Verify the result of the command is: `âœ“ Installed extension github/gh-valet`
   -  If you get a similar error to the following, click the link to authorize the token

   - Restart the codespace after clicking the link
- **Port 80 is not being forwarded for GitLab server**. This should be auto detected by codespaces, but can be manually setup by:
  - In the codespace terminal click the PORTS tab
  - Click the "Add Port" button
  - Enter 80 and hit enter
